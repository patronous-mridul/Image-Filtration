# Image-Filtration

This is one more Computer Vision project.
It uses openCV module of python to add different filters on an image and to save them also.
The coolest part of it is , it's Face Detection feature using harrcascade_frontalface_default.xml file.

Steps to run it :

1. Just download the zip file and unzip it or simply copy paste this -  'git clone https://github.com/patronous-mridul/Image-Filtration.git'
2. Now go to the folder where files persist and open terminal.
3. Run the following command using terminal : python filteration_of_images.py
4. And there you go.

NOTE : All the required modules are already present in the file. So, no need to worry for that also.
